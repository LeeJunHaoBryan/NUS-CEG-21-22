## Feedback for bljhty
### digits
- Your `digits` fails to pass 6 of the test cases. For this question, there is a -1 penalty for each failed test. In addition to the test cases based on MNIST we released as part of the assignment, additional test caess were crafted. These test cases have been added to your repo (digits.1.in to digits.16.in).
- Your `digits` is buggy when malloc/calloc fails. For this question, there is a -1 penalty for bug that occurs when memory allocation fails.
- `clang` and `clang-tidy` are happy with your `digits.c`. No warnings are generated. :confetti_ball:
- You can find [the comments from the grader (if any) here](https://www.github.com/nus-cs1010-2122-s1/as09-bljhty/commit/11cbabab0c17aed8510e3496fc721f219efc5547).
